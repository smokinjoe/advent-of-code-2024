## Advent of Code 2024

As part of the yearly tradition, this is my attempt at solving each Advent of Code day for 2024.

## How to run

From the console, you can provide flags to help run specific days and data:

eg.

`DAY=two pnpm dev` will perform Part One and Part Two of day 2.

`DAY=one pnpm example` will perform Part One and Part Two of day 1 using the example data.
